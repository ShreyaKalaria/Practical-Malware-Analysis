# Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis

### Reverse Engineering(RE)

* I am planning to start with very basics like Internals of compiling ie., How is a C program converted into machine code?  to different types of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

* Also planning to cover Methods of Exploitation starting from classic shellcode injection to Return Oriented Programming and it's variants.

* All this will be done on Ubuntu(A GNU/Linux system).Ubuntu comes with an amazing Debugger(GDB)  and a large number of command-line tools which help a lot during reading and understanding binaries. 

*  In the process, one will learn a bit of Linux OS Internals.

### Malware Analysis(MA)

* Book being followed: **Practical Malware Analysis** by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig.

* The **Malware Analysis** directory has 
	* Solutions and detailed explanation to samples of all chapters.
	* Also contains images and screenshots for every sample.
	* Explanation of all the important functions imported by the samples.
	* Some concepts which require explanation in more detail to understand stuff.

* This book focuses on Malware designed to attack Windows OS. So, in the process, concepts of Windows OS Internals also gets strengthened.



#### How to go about?

* Starting with Reverse Engineering first and then Malware Analysis is the suggested path. Because at the end of RE, one will be very comfortable with assembly code, binaries disassembly, debugging and much more.If one starts Malware Analysis with that comfort, he/she wont not get stuck at places which might seem difficult without basic knowledge of RE.

* Understanding Intel assembly(x86 or x64) is a very important skill for RE and MA.

* Learning the essentials of a debugger, how it works is very important. Because, in Ubuntu we use GDB. But on windows, some debugger like OllyDBG is used. 

* Tools keep changing, but the techniques and tricks are the ones which we should keep in mind.

* Resouces related to RE and MA will be put into the **Resources** Directory.
