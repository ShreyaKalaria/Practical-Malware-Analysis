## Practical Malware Analysis

* Book being followed: **Practical Malware Analysis** by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig.

* The **Malware Analysis** directory has 
	* Solutions and detailed explanation to samples of all chapters.
	* Also contains images and screenshots for every sample.
	* Explanation of all the important functions imported by the samples.
	* Some concepts which require explanation in more detail to understand stuff.

* This book focuses on Malware designed to attack the Windows Operating System. So, in the process, concepts of Windows OS Internals also gets strengthened.

* You can download all the malware samples used in this book from [this repository](https://github.com/mikesiko/PracticalMalwareAnalysis-Labs) . 


### How to get started?

* Starting with some basics of Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation first and then diving into Malware Analysis is a good way to get started. Because at the end of Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation, one will be  comfortable with assembly code, binaries, disassembly, debugging and much more. These are the very basics which are needed to understand Malware.

* Understanding Intel assembly(x86 or x64) is a very important skill for RE and MA.

* Learning the essentials of a debugger, how it works is very important. Because, in Ubuntu we use GDB. But on windows, we use a debugger like OllyDBG . 

* Tools keep changing, but the techniques and tricks are the ones which we should keep in mind.


### Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation

This repository had articles on Internals of Compiling, Memory Layout of a process and x86 Architecture. Now, I stopped writing here. 

All the resources, articles related to RE and BE have been moved to my blog - [www.pwnthebox.net](https://www.pwnthebox.net).
