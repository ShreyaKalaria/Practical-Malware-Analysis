### Some important stuff related to Windows OS which I came across in the book or lab samples, which needed more explanation.

1. **What are the differences among a process, application and a service?**
This link cleared the whole thing up. Link: https://superuser.com/questions/209654/whats-the-difference-between-an-application-process-and-services

2. What are **access tokens**?

3. What is linking?
Exp:
        Functions used by a program that are actually stored in a different file such as **code libraries**, that contain functionality common to many programs. Code libraries are connected to the main executable by the process of **Linking**.
4. What is a DLL?
Explanation:
      * DLL stands for **Dynamic-Link Library**. It is how the concept of Shared-libraries is implemented in Windows OS.
      * A DLL is a module that contains **functions** and **data** used by another module(could be an application or another DLL).
      * There are 2 types of DLLs.
                * **Exported** : Functions of these DLLs can be used by other modules and functions of the same DLL.
                * **Internal** : Functions of these DLLs can be called only by functions of the same DLL.

	  * The **Windows API** is implemented as a set of DLLs, so any process that yses DLL uses **Dynamic Linking**.
        * Types of Dynamic Linking:
	        * **Loadtime Dynamic linking** :
                 * A module makes explicit calls to exported DLL functions as if they were **local** functions.
                        * An Import Library supplies the System with Information needed to load the DLL and locate the imported functions when the application is loaded.(**At load time**).
           * **Runtime Dynamic Linking** :
                * A module uses **LoadLibrary** or **LoadLibraryEx** functions to load the DLL at **Runtime**.
                 * After the DLL is loaded, the module calls **GetProcAddress** function to get addresses of the imported DLL functions. So, there is no need of Import Library.
        *  Every Process that loads the DLL maps it into the **Virtual Address Space** of that process.

5. What is **Portable Executable** ?
Exp:
* PE/Portable Executable is a file format which is a Data structure that contains all the necessary data for the Windows OS loader to manage the executable code inside it.
* This is analogous to the **ELF/Executable and Linkable Format** of UNIX-like systems.
* Best way to learn more is from the msdn library.
