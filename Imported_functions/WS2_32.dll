### Important Functions encountered so far.

**Basic Network Functions**

1. **WSAStartup** :
	* This function **initiates** the use of Windows socket functions by a process.
	* So, This will be the first function from WS2_32.dll to be run by the process before using any other network function.
2. **WSACleanup** :
	* Terminates the use of WS2_32.dll. Releases all the Data structures allocated for the process by the OS.
	* If the process wants to use network functions after executing this function, it has the run the WSAStartup function again.

3. **socket** : 
	* Creates a Socket that is bound to a specific **Transport Service Provider**.
4. **closesocket** :
	* Closes the socket created by the **socket** function. 
5. **connect**:
	* This function is generally executed by a client machine which wants to **connect** to a server which is **listen**ing. 
6. **send** and **recv**:
	* Used to transfer data from one machine to another once the sockets of the 2 machines are connected.
7. **inet_addr** :
	* The IP Address is stored as a string in a computer. When passed through this function, it returns the **network equivalent** of that string IP Address.
	* The network equivalent is 4-byte unsigned integer. 
	* This conversion is done because, the Integer form of IP Address is the one present in the packet and not the string form.
8. **htons** :
	* htons stands for **Host to Network Short**. 
	* This function generally is used to convert the port number which is in host form to network form of 2 bytes size. 
9. **shutdown** :
	* Disables the socket from sending or receiving any data. 
	* But this is equivalent(but not equal) to disconnecting the connection. 


**PS**: This is quick reference. For detailed explanation of the functions, MSDN(Microsoft Developers' Network) Library is the best place.
