### Imported functions encountered so far.

**File related functions**
1. **CreateFile** : 
	*	Creates or opens a file or an I/O device.
	*	I/O device can be a normal file, a file stream, directory, Disk, Volume, Buffer, Pipe, Mailslot.
	*	Returns an **open handle** to the File on success.
2. **WriteFile** : 
	*	Write Data to a file / I/O device.

3. **MoveFile** :
	* Moves a file or a directory(including it's children) from one location to another.
	* One problem with this function is that, it fails if the source and destination locations are present in different volumes.
4. **CopyFile** :
	*  Copies an existing file to a new file.
	* If this is used to copy an encrypted file, it attempts to encrypt the destination file with the keys used in the encryption of the source file. If that cannot be done, Function attempts to encrypt the destination file with Default keys.
5. **CreateFileMapping** : 
	* Creates/Opens a named/unnamed file mapping object for a specific file.
	* After a file mapping object is created, size of the file should not exceed the size of the file Mapping Object.
	* Returns a **handle** to the newly created file mapping object.
	* Just creating the handle does not map the file to main memory space. There are other functions which use this handle and map the file to the memory space.
6. **MapViewOfFile** :
	* Maps a file in the disk onto the address space of a calling process. 
	* Mapping a file makes the specified portion of the file visible in the address space of the calling process.
	* Similar to **mmap()** in Linux systems.
	* Returns the **Starting Address** of the mapped view on success.
7. **UnmapViewofFile** :
	* Unmaps a mapped view of a file from the calling process's address space. Unmapping a mapped view of a file invalidates the range occupied by the view in the address space of the process and makes the range available for other allocations.
	* Similar to **munmap()** in Linux systems.
	* Returns non-zero value on success, 0 on failure.
8. **FindFirstFile**: 
	* **Searches** a given directory for a **File** or **Subdirectory** with a name that matches a specific name or partial names if **wildcards** are used.
	* Returns a **Search handle** on success. This handle is then used by **FindNextFile**, **FindClose**.
	* Returns information about the first file that the Filesystem finds with a name that matches the specified pattern.
9. **FindNextFile**:
	* Search for the **next file** in the parameter list using the same search handle opened by FindFirstFile.
10. **FindClose** :
	* Closes the file search handle opened by any of the other Find functions. 

**Process and Thread Related Functions**

1. **CreateProcess** : 
	* Creates a new process and it's primary thread. 
	* The new process runs in the security context of the calling process.
	* Returns non-zero value on success, 0 on failure.

2. **ExitProcess** :
	* This function is the preferred way to kill a process.
3. **OpenProcess** :
	* Opens an existing local process object.
	* To open a handle to another process and obtain full access rights, the **SeDebugPrivilege** should be enabled.
	
4. **GetCurrentProcess** : 
	* Returns a pseudo handle to the current process.
	* The handle has maximum access allowed by the security descriptor of the process to the primary token of the process.
5. **CreateThread** :
	* Creates a thread to execute within the Virtual Address space of the calling process.
	* Returns a handle to the new thread on success.
	* **IMP**: Thread is created even if it refers to **Invalid/Missing** DLLs.
6. **CreateRemoteThread** :
	* Creates a thread that runs in the Virtual Space of **another** process.
	* Returns a handle to the new thread on success.
	* Causes a new Thread of execution to begin in the Address Space of a **Specified Process**. The Thread has access to all objects that the process opens.
	* **Commonly Used**: To **inject** a thread into a process. Seems like something a malware would do.
7. **CreateMutex**: 
	* Creates / opens a named/unnamed mutex object.
	* A Mutex is a process synchronization mechanism which is used to to ensure **Mutual Exclusion** while executing a **Critical Section**.
8. **OpenMutex** : 
	* Opens an existing Mutex object.
	* Returns a handle to the mutex object on success.
	* **IMP**: Enables multiple processes to open handles of the same mutex object.
9. **ExitThread**:
	* Preferred method to Exit a thread.
10. **WinExec**:
	* This is very important function from malware analysis point of view.
	* This function can execute / run another application or process.
	* But this function is only for 16-bit windows. **CreateProcess** must be used instead of this.    

**Resource manipulation functions**

1. **FindResource** :
	* Determines the **location** of a Resource with the specified **type** and **name** in the specified module.
2. **SizeofResource** :
	* Retrieves the size of the Resource in **bytes**.

3. **LoadResource** :
	* Retrieves a handle that can be used to obtain a **pointer** to the **first byte** of the specified resource in memory.


**Other important functions**

1. **CloseHandle** :
	* Closes an open object handle.
	* This can close the handles of many objects including
		* File
		* File Mapping
		* Mutex
		* Process
		* Semaphore
		* Thread
		* Console I/P
		* Access Token
		* Communication Device
			and many more.
2. **Sleep** :
	* **Suspends**(not terminates) the execution of the current thread until the time-out interval elapses.

3. **SystemTimeToFileTime** :
	* Converts Time in system format to time in file format.
	* **SystemTime**: Current Date and Time of the day. The System keeps time so that the applications have ready access to accurate time.
	* **FileTime** : UTC Time. 
4. **GetTempPath** :
	* Retrieves the **path of the directory** designated for temporary files.
	* Checks for the existence of Environment Variables in the following order and uses the first path found.
		* **TMP** variable's path.
		* **TEMP**
		* **USERPROFILE**
		* **WindowsDirectory**
5. **GetWindowsDirectory** :
	* Retrieves the path of the Windows Directory.
	* The Windows directory is a space where **legacy** applications store their initialization files and help files.
6. **LoadLibrary** :
	* Loads a specific module into the Address Space of the calling process. 
	* The specified module may cause other modules to be loaded.
	* **IMP** function.
7. **GetProcAddress** :
	* Retrieves the Address of an exported function / variable from the specified DLL.  
	* **IMP** function.
