### Summary:
* Keywords:<br/>
	**Host-based Signatures** : Also know as indicators. These identify files created or modified by the malware or the specific changes made in the registry. The Indicator focuses on what the malware does to the system than the structure, characteristic and internal design of the malware(Anti-Virus signatures focus on these).<br/>
	**Network Signatures** : These signatures are written by monitoring network traffic. <br/>
	**Static Analysis** : Examining the malware without running it. 
	* Basic analysis includes checking the strings in the malware image, checking the headers of the image, checking different sections of the executable image.
	* Actual effective analysis happens when the executable is disassembled. When disassembled, we have the source code of the malware in assembly language. This gives a very clear picture of the functionality of the malware.<br/>
	
	**Dynamic Analysis** : Running the malware and noting down it's behavior.
	* Basic analysis includes setting up a fake network, capturing traffic, noting down the changes made by the malware to the registry and much more.
	* More effective analysis happens when the malware is run using a debugger and actually see the control flow of the malware.
	

	Analysis is most effective when both static and dynamic methods are combined.
	
* Types of Malware:
	* Backdoor
	* Botnet
	* Downloader
	* Information-stealing Malware
	* Launcher
	* Rootkit
	* Scareware
	* Spam-sending Malware
	* Worm
	* Virus
	and awesome hybrids of one or more above mentioned basic malware.

PS: In Windows, the term **image** is used in place of an **executable** file. Both the terms mean the same.
