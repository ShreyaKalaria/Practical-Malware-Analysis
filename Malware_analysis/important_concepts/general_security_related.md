### This consists of definitions, explanations of several security related terms encountered in the book.

1. **Entropy** of a file. What is it?
Explanation: 
      *	Classic definition of Entropy: Entropy as it relates to digital information is the measurement of Randomness in the given data.
       * There is a formula given by Shannon which is used to calculate entropy. Link: http://www.bearcave.com/misl/misl_tech/wavelets/compression/shannon.html
        * How is this useful?
	        *  If the entropy of a file is close to 0, it means the data inside it is more ordered or non-random.
	        * The maximum entropy is 8. If entropy of a file is closer to 8, it means the data inside it is very random.
	        * Generally, normal data has less entropy than data which is **encrypted**, **compressed**. So, it is used to detect **Encryption**, **Compression**, **Packing**, **Obfuscation**.
	        * Useful if the executable is purposefully encrypted with a **Real-time** Decryption routine. A great advantage of having a real-time decryption routine is that, it prevents the AV from seeing **inside** the executable as it sits on the disk in order to detect strings/patterns.

2. **Network Capture** : Network capture or Packet Capture is capturing all the data packets flowing in and out of a particular computer network. The tool used to capture packets is known as a packet sniffer. Some of the famous sniffers are Wireshark and tcpdump. **packcap** is a very simple packet sniffer written by me to understand the internals of a sniffer. You can use it and understand more about network capture. Link: https://github.com/adwait1-G/packcap 

3.  **IDS(Intrusion Detection System)** : IDS is a Network Security system which monitors Computers and Network traffic, analyzes the network traffic and detect and alert if there are any attempts to break into the network or a system.<br/> IDSs can be broadly classified into 2 types.
	   *	**Host based IDS** : This type of IDS monitors network traffic of a particular host/machine.
        * **Network based IDS** : This type of IDS monitors network traffic in and out of a whole network. It complements the Firewall of the network.

 4.  **Signature** : A Signature of anything is unique to itself. In this context, a malware has it's own methods to interact with the target machine , with the internet if it wants to download something malicious etc.,  So, all those unique methods of are identified and a signature is written. Eg:
        * Suppose a malware is present in the target machine and it regularly communicates with this IP Address: 99.101.123.234 (example). After analyzing this IP Address, it is found that this is where the malware is downloading some other malicious file from. So, this IP Address can be used to write a signature. If, any other application(which is not yet been caught as malware) communicates with this IP Address, it is caught because of the signature.

  5. **Malware** : Short form of Malicious Software is Malware. This is any software which causes harm to the computer system or the network. 
  6. **Malware Analysis** : Art of dissecting malware to understand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it. (This is taken from the book)
  7.   **Host-based Signatures** : Also know as indicators. These identify files created or modified by the malware or the specific changes made in the registry. The Indicator focuses on what the malware does to the system than the structure, characteristic and internal design of the malware(Anti-Virus signatures focus on these).<br/>
  8. **Network Signatures** : These signatures are written by monitoring network traffic. <br/>
  9. **Static Analysis** : Examining the malware without running it.
        * Basic analysis includes checking the strings in the malware image, checking the headers of the image, checking different sections of the executable image.
        * Actual effective analysis happens when the executable is disassembled. When disassembled, we have the source code of the malware in assembly language. This gives a very clear picture of the functionality of the malware.<br/>

  10. **Dynamic Analysis** : Running the malware and noting down it's behavior.
        * Basic analysis includes setting up a fake network, capturing traffic, noting down the changes made by the malware to the registry and much more.
        * More effective analysis happens when the malware is run using a debugger and actually see the control flow of the malware.


        Analysis is most effective when both static and dynamic methods are combined.
        
11. **Types of Malware** :
	 * Backdoor
      *	Botnet
       *	Downloader
        * Information-stealing Malware
        * Launcher
        * Rootkit
        * Scareware
        * Spam-sending Malware
        * Worm
        * Virus
        and awesome hybrids of one or more above mentioned basic malware.

12. **Anti-Virus** : A software which is installed in a computer system to detect malicious files(malware) and prevent them from damaging the system. They use 2 important methods to catch malware.
	* **File Signatures** : AV consists of a Huge Database of identifiable pieces of known suspicious code. These pieces of code are known as signatures. 
	* **Heuristics** : Behavioral and pattern-matching analysis to identify suspect files. 
Heuristics is often successful in catching unknown malicious code, but can be bypassed by new and unique malware.

13. **Hashing** : 	
*	A **Hash Function** is ideally a one-one function which takes in a variable-sized input and generates a output of constant length. For an ideal Hash function, Every input has a unique output. 
*	Practically, due to size of output string, 2 inputs can have the same output. 
	*	Eg: MD5(Message Digest 5) is a popular hashing algorithm which generates a 128-bit output string.
	*	So, there are 2^128 unique output strings. But the number of input strings is **infinite**. So, by pigeon hole principle, Some 2 input strings will have the same output string/ same hash. This is known as a **Collision**.

* As the length of the output string increases, probability of collision decreases. Presently, the hash functions used are SHA-256(256-bit output), SHA-512(512-bit output).
* What does it have to do with malware analysis?
	* Consider every hash function is an ideal hash function.
	* When the malicious program is run through the hashing function, it produces a hash. **That hash is unique to that program**. It is like a **fingerprint**.
	* The unique hash can be used as 
		* The Hash can be used as a **label** to identify that particular malicious program.
		* Search for that hash online to see if the file has already been identified.
	
14. **Packing and Obfuscation** :
	* The dictionary meaning of obfuscate is to convert something understandable into something unclear, so that it cannot be understood anymore easily.
	* **Obfuscated Programs** are ones whose execution the malware author has attempted to hide. 
	* **Packed programs** are a subser of obfuscated programs in which the malicious program is compressed and cannot be analyzed.
