Questions: <br/>
**1]** Upload the Lab01-03.exe file to http://www.VirusTotal.com/. Does it match any existing antivirus definitions?
Solution: 
55/66 AV Engines detected it as malicious. Many AVs classified it as a FSG packed malware.

**2]** Are there any indications that this file is packed or obfuscated? If so, what are these indicators? If the file is packed, unpack it if possible.
Solution:
Yes. This executable is a packed one.
Signs of it being packed.

* Analyzing the strings of the image: Many strings are wierd and unclear.
* There are only 2 functions imported from KERNEL32.dll: 
	* **LoadLibrary** and **GetProcAddress** : These 2 functions are more than enough for an executable to load any library and execute any procedure in it. Generally, the unpacking routine will use these functions. That's why, the names of these functions are not obfuscated.
	
*  PEiD analysis: This is most strong sign. The PEiD tool indicated that the packer is **FSG 1.0 -> dulek/xt** .

**3]** Do any imports hint at this programâ€™s functionality? If so, which imports are they and what do they tell you?
Solution: I did not find a tool which will unpack the FSG packing. This answer will be updated once the tool is found.

**4]** What host- or network-based indicators could be used to identify this malware on infected machines?
Solution: Answer will be updated once the FSG unpacking tool is found.
