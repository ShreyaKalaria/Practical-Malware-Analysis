### Summary:

* Keywords: <br/><br/>**Network Capture** : Network capture or Packet Capture is capturing all the data packets flowing in and out of a particular computer network. The tool used to capture packets is known as a packet sniffer. Some of the famous sniffers are Wireshark and tcpdump. **packcap** is a very simple packet sniffer written by me to understand the internals of a sniffer. You can use it and understand more about network capture.

	* Host based IDS : This type of IDS monitors network traffic of a particular host/machine.
	* Network based IDS : This type of IDS monitors network traffic in and out of a whole network. It complements the Firewall of the network.  
	
	 **Signature** : A Signature of anything is unique to itself. In this context, a malware has it's own methods to interact with the target machine , with the internet if it wants to download something malicious etc.,  So, all those unique methods of are identified and a signature is written. Eg:
	* Suppose a malware is present in the target machine and it regularly communicates with this IP Address: 99.101.123.234 (example). After analyzing this IP Address, it is found that this is where the malware is downloading some other malicious file from. So, this IP Address can be used to write a signature. If, any other application(which is not yet been caught as malware) communicates with this IP Address, it is caught because of the signature.  
	
	 <br/> **Malware** : Short form of Malicious Software is Malware. This is any software which causes harm to the computer system or the network. <br/><br/> **Malware Analysis** : Art of dissecting malware to understand how it works, how to identify it, and how to defeat or eliminate it.
